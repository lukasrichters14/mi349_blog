            <h3>Ecosia</h3>
            <h4>Published on <time datetime="2021-10-08">10/8/21</time>, by <a href="/about.html" rel="author">Lukas Richters</a></h4>
            <p>
                About an hour ago, I learned about a search engine called <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a>. 
                I'm still freaking 
                out. Ecosia is a search engine (think Google) that uses ad revenue generated by its 
                users to plant trees and invest in green projects. It is a not-for-profit organization 
                that does everything that I want a company to do. First, let's start with their 
                infrastructure. According to their <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">website</a>, 
                "Ecosia is powered by 200% 
                renewable energy." Not only does their entire network infrastructure run on renewable 
                energy, but they also have an excess of renewable power. That is massively important. 
                The entirety of their platform contributes nothing to their carbon footprint, and those 
                savings are passed on to the users. Sure, one google search will use a minuscule amount 
                of energy, but with billions of searches per day, that adds up quickly. Let's be clear 
                here, the power that your laptop uses to make an Ecosia search is (I'm assuming) 
                non-renewable. However, the energy that Ecosia's servers use is renewable. Even though 
                it would be a minimal saving to your carbon footprint, every little bit helps. Ecosia is 
                also very transparent about how they spend their money. They release a financial report 
                every month, detailing exactly how much money they spend and where they spend it. It is 
                extremely refreshing. Lastly, and most importantly, Ecosia's profits go immediately to 
                promoting the sustainability of our world. By planting trees and funding green projects, 
                Ecosia directly contributes to reforestation efforts and preserving ecosystems. I have 
                never been so excited to use the internet.

            <h3>My First Post</h3>
            <h4>Published on <time datetime="2021-10-08">10/8/21</time>, by <a href="/about.html" rel="author">Lukas Richters</a></h4>
            <p>
                This blog was started as part of a school assignment for a web development class. 
                However, I see no reason why it should not continue afterward. To that end, I 
                plan to use this blog as an outlet for my current interests and activities, 
                whatever they may be at the time. Currently, the vast world of chess has piqued my 
                interest. It is a game that I have known how to play for quite a while, probably 
                since middle school. Though, a more accurate statement would be that I knew the 
                <em>rules</em> in middle school. I naively assumed that it was just a strategy game like 
                any other, and one only had to practice to become a proficient player. While I'm 
                sure that is true to some extent, it woefully misrepresents the enormous body of 
                theory and expertise that the best chess players must understand to compete at the 
                highest level. It is not enough to know how to capture with a pawn or how to move 
                a knight. That is the fundamental knowledge that one must have to understand the 
                game. Knowing the rules means almost nothing compared to a player that understands 
                pawn structure, openings, defenses, forks, pins, and dozens of other techniques 
                that I have never heard. I only know the names of most of the examples I just 
                gave. Though it is entirely overwhelming, I am excited about the lifelong journey 
                that I am beginning.
